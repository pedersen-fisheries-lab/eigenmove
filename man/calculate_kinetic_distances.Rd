\usage{
calculate_kinetic_distances(
  movement_matrix,
  d,
  T,
  sigma_val = 1e-16,
  discrete_time = FALSE,
  scale_by_density = FALSE,
  keep_imaginary = FALSE,
  progress_bar = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{movement_matrix}{Matrix giving the probability of movement
from any point of the landscape to any other point. A square matrix
whose size is the number of points in the landscape.}

\item{d}{Number of dimensions to retain}

\item{sigma_val}{If sigma_val is non-null, this function uses the "shift-and-invert"
mode to calculate eigenvectors and values. Recommended for very large matrices.
Set to NULL if you don't want to use this method}

\item{discrete_time}{Set to TRUE if movement model uses discrete time.}

\item{scale_by_density}{Set to TRUE to scale by the inverse of patch-specific long-term occupancy.}

\item{keep_imaginary}{Set to TRUE to retain complex values in calculation.}

\item{progress_bar}{Set to TRUE to view calculation progress.}
