## Symbols and notation

Generator matrix (for random walk): $\mathbf{Q}$

Movement matrix (at time $\tau$): $\mathbf{M}(\tau)$ 

* For continuous time: $\mathbf{M}(\tau)  =  e^{\mathbf{Q}*\tau}$ 

* For discrete time: $\mathbf{M}(\tau) = \mathbf{M}(1)^\tau$

* Over an average lifespan: $\tilde{\mathbf{M}}(\tau,m) = exp(\tau(\mathbf{Q}-m\mathbf{I})$

#### Instantaneous encounter probability
Probability of individuals who started out in sites $x$ and $y$ respectively encountering one another after time delay $\tau$). Organized in an intantaneous encounter probability matrix:
$$
\mathbf{E}_{xy}
= \delta_x'
\mathbf{M}'(\tau)
\mathbf{M}(\tau)
\delta_y
$$

With instantaneous encounter distance at time $\tau$: 
$$
\mathbf{D_E^2}(\tau)_{x,y} 
= 
\mathbf{E}(\tau)_{xx}
+
\mathbf{E}(\tau)_{yy}
-
2*\mathbf{E}(\tau)_{xy}
$$

#### Average interaction rate
Average interaction rate per unit time between individuals who started out in sites $x$ and $y$ respectively across some continuous time period $T$. Organized in an average interaction rate matrix:

$$
\mathbf{I}_{xy}(T) = 
\frac{1}{T}
\int_0^T
\alpha
\mathbf{E}_{xy}(\tau)
d\tau
=
\frac{1}{T}
\int_0^T
\alpha
\mathbf{M}'(\tau)
\mathbf{M}(\tau)
\delta_y 
d\tau
$$

With average interaction distance over time $T$, organized in average interaction distance matrix:
$$
\mathbf{D_I^2}(T)_{x,y} 
= 
\mathbf{I}(T)_{xx}
+
\mathbf{I}(T)_{yy}
-
2*\mathbf{I}(T)_{xy}
$$

#### Lifespan-averaged interaction rates 
Interaction rate per average lifespan between individuals who started out in sites $x$ and $y$ respectively with density-independent mortality rate $m$ and average lifespan of $\frac{1}{m}$. Organized in a lifespan-averaged interaction rate matrix:
$$
\mathbf{L}_{xy}(\tau,m)
=
\int_0^\infty
\delta_x'
\mathbf{M}'(\tau,m)
\mathbf{M}(\tau,m)
\delta_y 
d\tau
$$





With lifespan-averaged ($m$) interaction distance, organized an a lifespan-averaged interaction distance matrix:
$$
\mathbf{D_L^2}(m)_{x,y} 
= 
\mathbf{L}(m)_{xx}
+
\mathbf{L}(m)_{yy}
-
2\mathbf{L}(m)_{xy}
$$
